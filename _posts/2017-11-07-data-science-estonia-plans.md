*Note: this post relies on an assumption that we should do more data science in Estonia. To me, that is a reasonable claim because improving everything by a few percent each year (something that data science enables in almost every organisation) will compound to huge growth in the long term. However, this is not the main topic of this post, and I'll discuss it some other time.*

The main limiting factor in data science in Estonia seems to be a lack of senior people. Most job ads seem to require at least 2 years of work experience and at least some experience even for junior-level hires. This is completely understandable: companies want people who have previously built exactly the things the company needs. Data science as an explicit combination of statistics, engineering and business knowledge has not existed for long, which is why finding a senior data scientist today is a bit like finding a senior Android developer in 2008.

Assuming this is the main problem in Estonian data science today, what should we do? This is exactly the question I asked myself half a year ago. There is no clear answer to this because it's hard to find historical examples or previous efforts on similar things. Googling "how to build an industry in a country" doesn't help.

Experienced people don't magically appear out of nowhere. In fact, I believe the process of converting people from zero to experienced data scientists can be summarised with a funnel:

<img src="/images/funnel.svg" alt="Experienced data scientist funnel.">

At the very top we put in a person that has never heard of data science. The first step is to simply let her know what data science is. Next, we want her to become interested in data science -- its applications, career opportunities, the people involved, etc. After that, some form of education is necessary, and this might not be formal university education: it could come from self-study, MOOCs, mentoring, or whatever resources she can best make use of. The last crucial step is gaining experience. That is where we originally wanted to get to, and now we have factored the process into smaller steps for this.

The visualisation above is slightly misleading: the number of people in each step of the funnel is not correct (this should be visualised using the width of each step). My wild estimate is that here are perhaps 3000 people in Estonia aware of data science, 150 interested (a third of the ~500 in the [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/datasci.ee/)) 30 in education and 50 people with experience.

# Plan so far: informing students

Given this funnel we can compare different potential actions for improving the situation. The first obvious question to ask is: which step of the funnel should we work on? This strongly depends on the amount of resources available because the difficulty of improving each step varies wildly. It takes 20 seconds to tell someone what data science is, perhaps 10 minutes to get them interested and then months and years for giving education and experience. If I had unlimited time and money (i.e. full-time work backed by millions in funding), I'd likely start with education: mostly offering new courses and consolidating existing ones into a separate curriculum.

Data Science Estonia is heavily time-constrained (and not that much money-constrained -- if we'd have a good pitch for a project, we'd likely get support from private and public donors). In fact, let me summarise our current resources the way I see them:

* a few person-hours of proactive work a week,
* about 20 people's promises of reactive help (i.e. happy to help if needed but unlikely to propose something on their own),
* some money, subject to spending time for actually receiving it (pitching projects, writing applications, meeting, etc).

Given those constraints I decided to focus on the first two steps, awareness and interest. These can be done in small chunks and without long commitments, measured reasonably well, and have a fast feedback loop. In short, they're very amenable to fast experimentation. I also decided to not cast the net too wide -- giving talks to a broad audience is nice, but targeting groups of people who are most likely to enter the funnel and complete it is much, much better. It must also be easy to distinguish and reach these groups of people.

It may seem obvious in hindsight, but the best group is described as "university students in quantitative subjects, but not computer science.". This means students of physics, chemistry, materials science, biology, economics, and psychology (the list is definitely incomplete). Why?
* A quantitative background is probably strongly correlated with some programming experience. These two things are both important in data science and hard to learn on your own.
* Computer science students are in high demand already, so they're less open to switching direction.
* Most curricula, at least at the University of Tartu, don't lead to an obvious career path. There is almost no industry in Estonia that would require a physics or chemistry background, and places in academia are extremely limited. When students discover this, they'll be looking for alternatives (which *de facto* is going into IT for most physics students).

You'll notice I omitted math and statistics students from consideration. I'm slightly ambivalent about them because at least stats students seem to be fairly aware, educated and well-recruited.

A great way of learning about a new thing is having it explained by someone with a relatable background. An obvious implementation of this is letting a physicists-become-data-scientist present to physics students,
